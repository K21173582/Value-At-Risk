# Risk Management with Python

This repository contains Python implementations of Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) using multiple methods, including the historical, variance-covariance, and Monte Carlo approaches. The project is designed to help you understand and calculate these key financial risk metrics, which are widely used in portfolio and risk management.

## Overview
This project provides an in-depth exploration of risk management techniques using Python. The primary focus is on calculating VaR and ES, two popular measures of downside risk. The code is intended for portfolio managers, data scientists, and students who want to understand financial risk analysis and how to apply it in practice.

## Features
- Calculation of **Value at Risk (VaR)** at different confidence levels (e.g., 95%).
- Calculation of **Expected Shortfall (ES)** to estimate the average loss during extreme downside events.
- Three different methods for VaR computation:
  - Historical Method
  - Variance-Covariance Method
  - Monte Carlo Simulation
- Visualization of returns distribution with VaR and ES thresholds marked.
- Easy-to-understand code with comments.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/K21173582/risk-management-python.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Fetch historical stock data and calculate VaR and ES using the method of your choice.
2. Customize parameters such as the stock ticker, confidence level, and initial investment amount.
3. Run the Python scripts to compute risk metrics and visualize the results.

Example command:
```bash
python historical_var.py
